IniFileManager instructions:

- Before running the tests check in the /test subdirectory: you will find a test.txt file. 
  Inside the IniFileManagerTest class, defined in the file IniFileManagerTest.cpp, there is a variable named "path".
  Make sure you assign the variable "path" a string specifying the path of the file test.txt on your computer.
